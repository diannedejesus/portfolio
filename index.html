								<p>Growing up in a military family, I quickly learned to adapt to changes, and when our last stop led us to Puerto Rico, I was required to adjust to a new language, culture, and climate. Therefore, when my geeky dad brought home our first computer, I had no problem learning the ins and outs. I even ended up learning some DOS. This sparked my interest in science and technology, and in high school, I taught myself to code webpages with HTML and CSS.</p>

								<p>Which led to me taking programming classes in college as I studied biology, my other passion. After I graduated, I went to work with the government, where I held various positions that all had one thing in common, coding could get the job done more efficiently and provide better service to the people we served. I built several programs/applications for these jobs and currently strive to create web applications that facilitate my work with subsidized housing.</p>
								
								<p>I have found a deep passion for the technology field and am looking forward to pursuing this as my career path.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Update Contacts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/update_contacts.gif" alt="login page for update contacts application" /></span>
								<p>One time, at work, we had a process change last minute. This change required that all our clients needed emails associated with their accounts. We aren't a very tech-forward department, so we don't require this information. This meant we needed to call everyone to get an email; while we don't have a massive amount of clients, there is enough that after a few no answers, I thought there has to be a better way to do this. </p>

								<p>A quick search didn't result in anything I could use; since what I needed was an application that would let me mail our clients a letter (since we do have everyone's address and we already reached the few whose email we needed quickly).</p>

								<p>So while we slowly gathered the information, I decided that this would be an excellent project for me to do. My idea for this project is an application that can import an existing contact list, create a custom letter and email, and handle the entry of information that needs to be collected.</p>

								<p>It would be divided into two applications one that handles data entry from the client and the main application that interfaces with the data and accounts.</p>

								<p>This prototype can import contacts from an MS Exchange account (EWS/SOAP). The import populates two databases. First, a Historic database that contains all the imported data, and second a name database for the names of the contacts; for use in the data collection part.</p>

								<p>The main app analyzes and displays information on how the data collection is going, allows for importing and modifying the main list, creates a letter template for printing and an email template for sending. It permits the user to disable contacts (which disables for both parts of the app) and lets you verify the submitted information with the stored Historic database to assure you have the correct information.</p>

								<p>This application was made with Node.js with Express, Mongoose, EJS, Node-EWS, Bcrypt, Validator, Passport, etc. You find the code on my <a href='https://github.com/diannedejesus/update_contacts' target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">My To-do App</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/todoapp.PNG" alt="interfase for the to-do app" /></span>
								<p>There is nothing like creating a to-do app. I, like many people, found this project very inspiring. This could have been one of those projects that gets a way from you and remain unfinished in a remote folder somewhere. It is not easy scaling back when you first start, but you soon learn that trying to do everything (especially if you need it to be just right) means not completing even the simplest of projects. It is better to have something to show that needs polish that you can add to later; than nothing at all.</p>

								<p>My idea of a to-do list (after delving deep into the productivity world); is an app where you can easily add new ideas, events, and tasks but does not display every task/event on your list. This helps keep you from feeling overwhelmed with the things you need to do while not letting you lose track of all those items. You can quickly view them and set which items you need to prioritize for the day. It will display the ones you have completed, letting your busy mind relax when you take your breaks. This works because you can see what has already been accomplished.</p>

								<p>This application was made with Node.js, using Express, Mongoose, EJS, etc. You can find the code on my <a href='https://github.com/diannedejesus/100devs_todo' target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Also, give it a try <a href='http://app-que-hacer.herokuapp.com/' target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Plant Store</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/plantStore.png" alt="screenshot of plant store website" /></span>
								<p>I have a thing for plants and gardening. Wish I could say this meant I  was good at keeping all my plants alive, but sometimes life happens. I do have a decent track record, though. This is why, when I recreated this mockup, I decided to turn it into a plant store.</p>
								
								<p>The website is fully responsive, with information for the store in the top navigation; this way, the user has immediate access to it. Then a gallery of the most popular sections of the store (something I added to the original design).</p>

								<p>Then it highlights certain plants; this is a great way to give clients immediate access to information on your most in-demand items, to focus on plants that are currently on sale or in season. </p>
									
								<p>The footer has a place for social feeds and a newsletter. You can preview this mockup <a href='projects/plantStore/' target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Starbucks Recreation</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/starbuck-org.png" alt="screenshot of full Starbucks Recreation page" /></span>
								<p>For this project, I really wanted to do a responsive design; that included animated elements in CSS. Now I don't know if the whole coffee obsession is a programming cliche or a way of life... but I definitely need a caffeine kick in the morning. So when I found this layout for Starbucks, I just had to build it (not sure if it's real). It had a minimal header and no footer. This made me open up the actual Starbucks website. Once I saw what the real deal looked like, I thought, I can use these! The best part is that they had some subtle animations I could use.</p>

								<p>In the timeframe set for the project, I completed all goals except for one. An animation for the menu button. I would have loved to have built it, yet since the main goal was to accomplish everything in CSS and HTML, I wasn't able to in the time set. I worked on this in my spare time, and other things needed my attention.</p>

								<p>It was a fun project to build. It included some very vivid and beautiful images. Great details for responsiveness and CSS animation practice. You can preview this mockup <a href='projects/starbucks/' target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<p>Why use a template? Easy I am not a designer, so while I have the skills to build my own reponsive portfolio site, it would not look as good as I want it to. Considering that... why not just choose a template that I like and use that? I could recreate it, but why reinvent the wheel when the wheel works just as I need it too? I did tweek some things to fit my needs.</p>
